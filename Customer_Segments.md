# Customer Segments
We strive to assist employers in maintaining dependable employees by enhancing workplace confidence and ability. There has been a high increase in employee turnover rate in recent years. Companies not only deal with maintaining their existing employees, but also must work on training hiring new ones.
With Digital Training Record, we provide a checklist of skills that an individual is qualified for, including where and when they received their certifications. Our application also makes it easier for hiring managers by saving time and resources when evaluating interviewees for new positions. By investing in our services in the first place, companies can save up much more time and cost on training new-hired employees later.
Our customers represent a variety of U.S. based corporations that value high-quality training in operational management. Our target market will be nursing care, residential care facilities, air transportation industries, big retail chains, and other industries with the highest worker compensations and OSHA violation claims. These industries are losing millions of dollars annually in compensation for preventable injuries and OSHA fines. This product will guarantee proper training to prevent future injury claims and OSHA violations. Our first targeted customer will be the Walmart Corporation.
