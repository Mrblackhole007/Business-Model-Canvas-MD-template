# Channels
<p>We will utilize Sales Representatives to manage new and current customer contact. We plan on using the following platforms to attract new customers. Social Media sites such as: "Facebook", "Twitter", "You Tube", "Instagram", "Tumblr" and "Linked In". We feel Web Advertising through Google could aid in attaching clients, initially we would limit our clicks to 50 a day and evaluating if more or less is beneficial. Considering, managers that might not be as tech savvy, we plan to use the old tried and true methods; phone calls, e-mails, our website and face-to-face contacts. 
We plan to peak our client's interest in our product by allowing them to use and evaluate our basic customizable program free for 120 days. Afterwards, we will have several purchase options to include; an annual, 2 years or 3 years subscriptions for our training record software. Subscription purchases, will be through our website or over the phone. Cost will be based on the clients number of employees and years subscribed. Support will be provided via our website, phone calls, on-line chat/video and in person if needed. All subscriptions include root, cause analysis training, and consulting on preventing OSHA mishaps.</p>
